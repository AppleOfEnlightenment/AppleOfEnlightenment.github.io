        Crocs sell foam clogs at a low price point because they want to bring consumersâ€™ attention to their quality.
        Consumers want to spend less on shoes, especially when it comes to fashion items such as athletic footwear.
        The company has also found success through social media marketing by posting pictures of its employees wearing its shoes.
        Crocs share a fun, relatable message that encourages customers to join them in their journey toward being happier.
